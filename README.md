# Bank_project
The customer is the credit department of the bank. 

Task: to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. 

Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers. 

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to return a loan to a bank.

Libraries: python (pandas)
